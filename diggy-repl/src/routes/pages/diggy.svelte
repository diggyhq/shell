<h2>Diggy</h2>

<p>Diggy, like Replit or Glitch, is a computational environment.</p>

<h3>Programming languages</h3>

<p>Diggy can run pretty much any programming language and run it in a
protected environment. Of course, as long as there is a binary that
runs on Linux.</p>

<h3>Secure</h3>

<p>Your code is executed in a sandboxed environment, and the results
are sent back to the browser. Since everything runs in a protected
sandbox you cannot access network interfaces or (hopefully!) break
anything. See <a href="/pages/limitations">limitations</a > for more
detail.</p>

<h3>When Diggy is not the right choice</h3>

<p>One example is large applications. At the end of the day, Diggy is
a playground. It is a trade-off between exploration and full-blown
applications. Eventually, I may reconsider this.</p>
