<h2>Diggy</h2>

<p>
  Diggy, like Replit or Glitch, is a computational environment.
</p>

<h3>Programming languages</h3>

<p>
  Diggy can run pretty much any programming language in a protected
  environment. Of course, as long as there is a binary that runs on
  Linux.
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>
  Your code is executed in a sandboxed environment, and the results
  are sent back to the browser. Since everything runs in a protected
  sandbox you cannot access network interfaces or (hopefully!) break
  anything. See <a href="/pages/limitations">limitations</a > for more
  detail.
</p>
