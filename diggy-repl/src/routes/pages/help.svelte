<h3>What's the deal about "Diggy"?</h3>

<p>I used to listen
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exyz4BtRhoc">this song</a>
a lot when I wanted get into and stay in the flow. Now, it is
imprinted in my brain. Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole...</p>

<h3>X doesn't work!</h3>

<p>Perhaps, you can <a href="/pages/contact">send me a message</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/diggyhq/shell/issues">file a
defect</a>. I will see what I can do.</p>

<h3>X is not supported</h3>

<p>Diggy is a one-man project. If it is not something that I have in
my roadmap, it is unlikely I will have resources to do this. However,
Diggy is <a href="https://github.com/diggyhq/shell">an open-source
project</a>, and you can contribute!</p>

<h3>What about SLA?</h3>

is still a beta so don’t ask me how many 9’s. You can have all the 8’s
you want."</a></quote></p>
